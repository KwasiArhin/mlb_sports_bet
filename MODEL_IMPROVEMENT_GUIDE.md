# 🚀 MLB Model Improvement Guide

## Current Model Performance Analysis

### 📊 Current Stats:
- **Model Type**: RandomForest (100 trees, depth 12)
- **Accuracy**: 59.3% (above MLB baseline of ~54%)
- **Training Data**: 105 games (limited)
- **Features**: 32 features (heavily pitcher-focused)

### 🎯 Top Feature Importance:
1. **Away Pitcher Extension** (6.6%) - Release point consistency
2. **Home Pitcher Total Pitches** (6.4%) - Workload/experience  
3. **Away Pitcher Bat Speed Against** (6.4%) - Opponent quality
4. **Away Pitcher Spin Rate** (6.2%) - Ball movement effectiveness
5. **Home Pitcher Strikeouts** (5.9%) - Dominance metric

## 🔧 Priority Improvements

### 1. **Expand Training Data**
```
Current: 105 games → Target: 1000+ games
- Collect 2-3 full seasons of historical data
- Include playoff games for high-pressure situations
- Add minor league call-up information
```

### 2. **Weather & Environmental Data**
```python
# High-impact features to add:
- temperature (affects ball flight)
- humidity (affects grip, ball movement) 
- wind_speed & wind_direction (major factor in HRs)
- ballpark_altitude (Coors Field effect)
- day_vs_night_game (visibility, temperature)
- dome_vs_outdoor (controlled environment)
```

**Data Sources:**
- WeatherAPI: `api.openweathermap.org`
- MLB Ballpark Info: Stadium dimensions & altitude

### 3. **Recent Performance Metrics**
```python
# Rolling statistics (L10, L20, L30 games):
- team_runs_scored_L10
- team_runs_allowed_L10  
- pitcher_era_L5_starts
- bullpen_era_L7_days
- batting_avg_vs_pitcher_handedness_L20
- home_away_splits_L15
```

### 4. **Advanced Matchup Data**
```python
# Historical head-to-head:
- pitcher_vs_opposing_team_era
- hitter_vs_pitcher_career_avg
- team_vs_starter_handedness (L/R splits)  
- divisional_game_performance
- rest_days_since_last_game
- travel_distance (West Coast to East Coast games)
```

### 5. **Injury & Roster Information**
```python
# Player availability:
- key_players_injured
- roster_changes_last_7_days
- starting_lineup_vs_expected
- bullpen_availability (pitched last 2 days?)
```

## 🌐 New Data Sources to Integrate

### **Free APIs:**
1. **MLB Stats API**: `statsapi.mlb.com`
   - Live game data, rosters, injuries
2. **ESPN API**: Player stats, team records
3. **Weather APIs**: Historical weather data
4. **BaseballSavant**: Advanced metrics (Statcast data)

### **Premium Sources (Worth Considering):**
1. **FanGraphs**: Advanced sabermetrics
2. **Baseball Reference**: Historical data depth
3. **The Athletic**: Expert injury reports
4. **Vegas Insider**: Line movement data

## 🧠 Model Architecture Improvements

### **Current Limitations:**
```python
# Issues with RandomForest:
- Limited to 100 trees (can go to 500+)
- Max depth of 12 (can go to 20+)  
- No feature interactions captured
- No temporal patterns learned
```

### **Recommended Algorithms:**
```python
# 1. XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)
import xgboost as xgb
model = xgb.XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=500,
    max_depth=8,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    subsample=0.8
)

# 2. LightGBM (Fast & Accurate)
import lightgbm as lgb
model = lgb.LGBMClassifier(
    n_estimators=500,
    max_depth=10,
    learning_rate=0.05,
    feature_fraction=0.8
)

# 3. Ensemble Method
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier
ensemble = VotingClassifier([
    ('rf', RandomForestClassifier()),
    ('xgb', xgb.XGBClassifier()),
    ('lgb', lgb.LGBMClassifier())
], voting='soft')
```

### **Feature Engineering Pipeline:**
```python
# Advanced feature creation:
def create_interaction_features(df):
    # Pitcher vs lineup matchup strength
    df['pitcher_vs_lineup_advantage'] = (
        df['pitcher_strikeout_rate'] - df['opposing_team_contact_rate']
    )
    
    # Weather impact on offense
    df['weather_offensive_boost'] = (
        df['temperature'] * 0.01 + df['wind_speed'] * 0.02
    )
    
    # Rest advantage
    df['rest_advantage'] = (
        df['home_rest_days'] - df['away_rest_days']
    )
    
    return df
```

## 📈 Model Evaluation Improvements

### **Current Issue:** Single accuracy metric
### **Better Approach:**
```python
# Cross-validation for robust evaluation
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit
tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)

# Multiple metrics
metrics = {
    'accuracy': accuracy_score,
    'precision': precision_score,
    'recall': recall_score, 
    'f1': f1_score,
    'roc_auc': roc_auc_score,
    'log_loss': log_loss  # Most important for betting!
}

# Betting-specific metrics
def calculate_betting_roi(y_true, y_pred_proba, odds):
    # Kelly Criterion performance
    # Expected value across all bets
    # Sharpe ratio of betting returns
```
